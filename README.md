# Project: HTML Video Player

## About
I've been doing some form of web development for about seven years or so... mostly basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I've taken two of [Udacity's](https://www.udacity.com) nanodegree programs: Front End and Full Stack Web Developer. I have learned a lot from those courses but I know that there are situations and use cases that I haven't seen or been exposed to.

I recently heard about Wes Bos and also his 30 Day JavaScript challenge. It's a free course (at least during the writing of this) and it can be found here: [javascript30.com](https://javascript30.com)

This project is a practice in writing vanilla JavaScript and to learn about other use cases.

#### Project takeaways
* `HTML5 Video` - Worked with HTML5 Video control attributes
* `video.play() | video.pause()` - Used JavaScript to determine state and play/pause a video in HTML5
* `video.currentTime | video.duration` - Used JavaScript to animate a scrub bar by determining the percent played of the video and to forward/reverse to a location by using the mouse
* `video[volume] and video[playbackRate]` - Used a sliding dial and JavaScript to adjust the volume of the video and the playback speed rate
* `document.fullscreenEnabled` - Worked with using and closing fullscreen use of video with `document.fullscreenEnabled`, `player.requestFullscreen`, and `document.exitFullscreen()`.
